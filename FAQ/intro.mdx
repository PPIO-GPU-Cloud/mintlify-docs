## Introduction

InfrAI offers a variety of GPU container cloud computing specifications to meet different virtualization capability needs, supporting a wide range of business applications and service scenarios.

Each computing specification is divided into several specification families based on hardware capability differences, with each family using different Intel processors, CPU/memory ratios, GPU cards, cloud disk types, and network card virtualization methods to achieve differentiated computing, storage, and network performance. Each family is further subdivided into various instance specifications, with higher specifications offering stronger performance.
