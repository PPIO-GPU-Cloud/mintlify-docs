## On-demand Pricing
### Introduction
On-Demand pricing is designed to offer users the flexibility to access computational resources without any long-term commitments or upfront costs. This pricing model is ideal for users who require compute power on an as-needed basis, whether it's for short-term projects, variable workloads, or unpredictable processing demands.
Billing Structure of On-Demand Pricing
The On-Demand pricing model is straightforward and easy to understand. The cost is calculated using the following formula:
- **Cost**: This is the total amount you'll be charged for using a cloud computing instance.
- **Instance pricing**: This is the hourly rate you pay for a specific type of instance, which depends on the kind of GPU and its configuration.
- **Billing time**: Billing is calculated on a per-second basis, reflecting the exact amount of compute time used. Although the cost computation is precise to the second, billing statements are issued hourly. 
- **Number of GPUs**: This is the number of graphics processing units (GPUs) assigned to your instance. The more GPUs you use, the more computing power you have available, but also the higher your cost will be.
Key Features of On-Demand Pricing
- **Immediate Access**: With On-Demand pricing, you can start and stop instances as needed, providing immediate access to computational resources.
- **No Commitment**: There are no contracts or long-term commitments, making it an excellent option for users who do not want to be tied down by fixed-term agreements.
- **Pay-as-You-Go**: You only pay for the time you use the compute resources, which can be cost-effective for sporadic or unpredictable usage patterns.
How On-Demand Pricing Works in Practice
- **Instance Creation**: The billing clock starts as soon as you create and launch your instance on the platform.
- **Usage Tracking**: InfrAI's system tracks the usage of your instances second by second, ensuring that your billing accurately reflects the actual compute time used.
- **Stopping and Deleting**: When you no longer need the instance, you can stop or delete it. The billing stops at the moment you perform this action, preventing unnecessary charges.
Advantages of On-Demand Pricing for Different Scenarios
- **Short-Term Projects**: For projects that have a limited duration, On-Demand pricing allows you to match your compute costs to the project timeline.
- **Variable Workloads**: If your workloads fluctuate, On-Demand pricing provides the flexibility to scale up or down as needed without incurring fixed costs.
- **Testing and Development**: For testing new applications or developing code, On-Demand pricing offers a cost-effective way to access the necessary compute resources without long-term financial commitments.

##  Savings Plans
### Introduction
Savings Plans are designed for users who can predict their compute resource needs over a set period. By prepaying for a certain duration, users can enjoy discounted rates on GPU instances, leading to significant cost savings. These plans are an excellent choice for users with steady and long-term compute requirements.
### How Savings Plans Work
- **Upfront Commitment**: Users pay a predetermined amount upfront for a commitment to use GPU cloud  services for a set period, typically ranging from 1 to 6 months.
- **Discounted Rates**: The commitment comes with a discount on the hourly rate for the GPU instances, making it more cost-effective than the On-Demand pricing.
- **Expiration and Renewal Strategy**: Savings Plans automatically apply the discounted rate to your compute usage upon activation, with no automatic renewals. Instead, we'll send a reminder email as your plan nears expiration, giving you the option to renew manually. If you choose not to renew, or once your plan expires, your instances will shift to the regular On-Demand pricing. Excess usage beyond your Savings Plan commitment is also billed at standard On-Demand rates, ensuring you're only charged for the resources you actually use. 
### Benefits of Savings Plans
- **Cost Savings**: The most significant advantage of Savings Plans is the substantial discount on the hourly rate for GPU instances, leading to considerable savings over time.
- **Predictable Expenses**: By prepaying for a set period, users can better manage and predict their compute expenses, which is beneficial for budgeting purposes.
- **Flexibility**: Users have the option to apply the Savings Plan to any uniform specification new instance they create during the commitment period, providing flexibility in resource allocation.
### Usage and Management of Savings Plans
- **Instance Association**: Savings Plans are tied to specific instance types and the number of GPUs. When a user deploys an instance, the plan is automatically applied to the billing for that instance.
- **Plan Management**: Users can manage their Savings Plans through the Infrai platform, making it easy to track usage, renewal dates, and associated instances.
- **Idle Resources**: If an instance associated with a Savings Plan is shut down, the plan remains active and can be applied to a new instance without any additional charges.
### Key Considerations
- **Non-Refundable**: It's important to note that the upfront payment for a Savings Plan is non-refundable. Therefore, users should be confident in their compute needs before committing to a plan.
- **Fixed Duration**: The duration of the Savings Plan is fixed and does not extend or shorten with changes in instance usage. Users should plan their compute requirements accordingly.
In summary, Infrai's Savings Plans provide a cost-effective and flexible solution for users with consistent compute needs. By committing to a usage period, users can enjoy discounted rates and better manage their cloud compute expenses. With straightforward management tools and the ability to apply the plan to any new instances, Savings Plans offer an excellent way to optimize your cloud compute investment.
## Storage Billing
we offer a comprehensive suite of storage solutions, tailored to meet the diverse needs of our users. Here's a breakdown of our storage options and their respective pricing:
Container Storage (Root File System Storage)
We provide an initial **30GB** of free container storage for each user. This storage is specifically designed to hold the root file system of your instances. Should your usage exceed this free tier, you will be billed at a rate of **$0.005/GB** per day for any additional storage used.
### Volume Storage
In addition to container storage, we also offer **60GB** of free Volume Storage. This type of storage is ideal for temporary data that requires quick access by your instances. Beyond the free allocation, the cost for extra usage is calculated based on the volume and duration of use, priced at **$0.005/GB** per day.
### Network Storage
Unlike container and local storage, network storage does not come with a free tier. It is billed solely based on usage volume and the time period it is utilized. Network storage is competitively priced at **$0.002/GB** per day. Network Storage is designed for versatility, allowing you to mount it on any instance within the same cluster for convenient data migration and flexible usage.
